The `mastra build` command bundles your Mastra project into a production-ready Hono server. Hono is a lightweight web framework that provides type-safe routing and middleware support, making it ideal for deploying Mastra agents as HTTP endpoints.

## Usage

```bash
mastra build [options]
```

## Options

- `--dir <path>`: Directory containing your Mastra project (default: current directory)

## What It Does

1. Locates your Mastra entry file (either `src/mastra/index.ts` or `src/mastra/index.js`)
2. Creates a `.mastra` output directory
3. Bundles your code using Rollup with:
   - Tree shaking for optimal bundle size
   - Node.js environment targeting
   - Source map generation for debugging

## Example

```bash
# Build from current directory
mastra build

# Build from specific directory
mastra build --dir ./my-mastra-project
```

## Output

The command generates a production bundle in the `.mastra` directory, which includes:
- A Hono-based HTTP server with your Mastra agents exposed as endpoints
- Bundled JavaScript files optimized for production
- Source maps for debugging
- Required dependencies

This output is suitable for:
- Deploying to cloud servers (EC2, Digital Ocean)
- Running in containerized environments
- Using with container orchestration systems

## Deployers
When a Deployer is used, the build output is automatically prepared for the target platform e.g
- [Vercel Deployer](/reference/deployer/vercel)
- [Netlify Deployer](/reference/deployer/netlify) 
- [Cloudflare Deployer](/reference/deployer/cloudflare)
