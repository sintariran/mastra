# Agents Guide: Building a Chef Assistant

In this guide, we'll walk through creating a "Chef Assistant" agent that helps users cook meals with available ingredients.

<YouTube id="_tZhOqHCrF0" />

## Prerequisites

- Node.js installed
- Mastra installed: `npm install @mastra/core`

---

## Create the Agent

<Steps>
### Define the Agent

Create a new file `src/mastra/agents/chefAgent.ts` and define your agent:

```ts copy filename="src/mastra/agents/chefAgent.ts"
import { openai } from "@ai-sdk/openai";
import { Agent } from "@mastra/core/agent";

export const chefAgent = new Agent({
  name: "chef-agent",
  instructions:
    "You are Michel, a practical and experienced home chef" +
    "You help people cook with whatever ingredients they have available.",
  model: openai("gpt-4o-mini"),
});
```

---

## Set Up Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in your project root and add your OpenAI API key:

```bash filename=".env" copy
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
```

---

## Register the Agent with Mastra

In your main file, register the agent:

```ts copy filename="src/mastra/index.ts"
import { Mastra } from "@mastra/core";

import { chefAgent } from "./agents/chefAgent";

export const mastra = new Mastra({
  agents: { chefAgent },
});
```

---

## Interacting with the Agent

<Steps>
### Generating Text Responses

```ts copy filename="src/index.ts"
async function main() {
  const query =
    "In my kitchen I have: pasta, canned tomatoes, garlic, olive oil, and some dried herbs (basil and oregano). What can I make?";
  console.log(`Query: ${query}`);

  const response = await chefAgent.generate([{ role: "user", content: query }]);
  console.log("\n👨‍🍳 Chef Michel:", response.text);
}

main();
```

Run the script:

```bash copy
npx bun src/index.ts
```

Output:

```
Query: In my kitchen I have: pasta, canned tomatoes, garlic, olive oil, and some dried herbs (basil and oregano). What can I make?

👨‍🍳 Chef Michel: You can make a delicious pasta al pomodoro! Here's how...
```

---

### Streaming Responses

```ts copy filename="src/index.ts"
async function main() {
  const query =
    "Now I'm over at my friend's house, and they have: chicken thighs, coconut milk, sweet potatoes, and some curry powder.";
  console.log(`Query: ${query}`);

  const stream = await chefAgent.stream([{ role: "user", content: query }]);

  console.log("\n Chef Michel: ");

  for await (const chunk of stream.textStream) {
    process.stdout.write(chunk);
  }

  console.log("\n\n✅ Recipe complete!");
}

main();
```

Output:

```
Query: Now I'm over at my friend's house, and they have: chicken thighs, coconut milk, sweet potatoes, and some curry powder.

👨‍🍳 Chef Michel:
Great! You can make a comforting chicken curry...

✅ Recipe complete!
```

---

### Generating a Recipe with Structured Data

```ts copy filename="src/index.ts"
import { z } from "zod";

async function main() {
  const query =
    "I want to make lasagna, can you generate a lasagna recipe for me?";
  console.log(`Query: ${query}`);

  // Define the Zod schema
  const schema = z.object({
    ingredients: z.array(
      z.object({
        name: z.string(),
        amount: z.string(),
      }),
    ),
    steps: z.array(z.string()),
  });

  const response = await chefAgent.generate(
    [{ role: "user", content: query }],
    { output: schema },
  );
  console.log("\n👨‍🍳 Chef Michel:", response.object);
}

main();
```

Output:

```
Query: I want to make lasagna, can you generate a lasagna recipe for me?

👨‍🍳 Chef Michel: {
  ingredients: [
    { name: "Lasagna noodles", amount: "12 sheets" },
    { name: "Ground beef", amount: "1 pound" },
    // ...
  ],
  steps: [
    "Preheat oven to 375°F (190°C).",
    "Cook the lasagna noodles according to package instructions.",
    // ...
  ]
}
```

## Running the Agent Server

<Steps>

### Using `mastra dev`

You can run your agent as a service using the `mastra dev` command:

```bash copy
mastra dev
```

This will start a server exposing endpoints to interact with your registered agents.

### Accessing the Chef Assistant API

By default, `mastra dev` runs on `http://localhost:4111`. Your Chef Assistant agent will be available at:

```
POST http://localhost:4111/api/agents/chefAgent/generate
```

### Interacting with the Agent via `curl`

You can interact with the agent using `curl` from the command line:

```bash copy
curl -X POST http://localhost:4111/api/agents/chefAgent/generate \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "messages": [
      {
        "role": "user",
        "content": "I have eggs, flour, and milk. What can I make?"
      }
    ]
  }'
```

**Sample Response:**

```json
{
  "text": "You can make delicious pancakes! Here's a simple recipe..."
}
```

</Steps>
