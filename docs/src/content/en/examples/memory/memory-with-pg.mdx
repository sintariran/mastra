# Memory with Postgres

This example demonstrates how to use Mastra's memory system with PostgreSQL as the storage backend.

## Setup

First, set up the memory system with PostgreSQL storage and vector capabilities:

```typescript
import { Memory } from "@mastra/memory";
import { PostgresStore, PgVector } from "@mastra/pg";
import { Agent } from "@mastra/core/agent";
import { openai } from "@ai-sdk/openai";

// PostgreSQL connection details
const host = "localhost";
const port = 5432;
const user = "postgres";
const database = "postgres";
const password = "postgres";
const connectionString = `postgresql://${user}:${password}@${host}:${port}`;

// Initialize memory with PostgreSQL storage and vector search
const memory = new Memory({
  storage: new PostgresStore({
    host,
    port,
    user,
    database,
    password,
  }),
  vector: new PgVector(connectionString),
  options: {
    lastMessages: 10,
    semanticRecall: {
      topK: 3,
      messageRange: 2,
    },
  },
});

// Create an agent with memory capabilities
const chefAgent = new Agent({
  name: "chefAgent",
  instructions:
    "You are Michel, a practical and experienced home chef who helps people cook great meals with whatever ingredients they have available.",
  model: openai("gpt-4o-mini"),
  memory,
});
```

## Usage Example

```typescript
import { randomUUID } from "crypto";

// Start a conversation
const threadId = randomUUID();
const resourceId = "SOME_USER_ID";

// Ask about ingredients
const response1 = await chefAgent.stream(
  "In my kitchen I have: pasta, canned tomatoes, garlic, olive oil, and some dried herbs (basil and oregano). What can I make?",
  {
    threadId,
    resourceId,
  },
);

// Ask about different ingredients
const response2 = await chefAgent.stream(
  "Now I'm over at my friend's house, and they have: chicken thighs, coconut milk, sweet potatoes, and curry powder.",
  {
    threadId,
    resourceId,
  },
);

// Use memory to recall previous conversation
const response3 = await chefAgent.stream(
  "What did we cook before I went to my friends house?",
  {
    threadId,
    resourceId,
    memoryOptions: {
      lastMessages: 3, // Get last 3 messages for context
    },
  },
);
```

The example shows:

1. Setting up PostgreSQL storage with vector search capabilities
2. Configuring memory options for message history and semantic search
3. Creating an agent with memory integration
4. Using the agent to maintain conversation context across multiple interactions
