# Summarization Evaluation

This example demonstrates how to use Mastra's Summarization metric to evaluate how well LLM-generated summaries capture content while maintaining factual accuracy.

## Overview

The example shows how to:

1. Configure the Summarization metric with an LLM
2. Evaluate summary quality and factual accuracy
3. Analyze alignment and coverage scores
4. Handle different summary scenarios

## Setup

### Environment Setup

Make sure to set up your environment variables:

```bash filename=".env"
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

### Dependencies

Import the necessary dependencies:

```typescript copy showLineNumbers filename="src/index.ts"
import { openai } from '@ai-sdk/openai';
import { SummarizationMetric } from '@mastra/evals/llm';
```

## Metric Configuration

Set up the Summarization metric with an OpenAI model:

```typescript copy showLineNumbers{4} filename="src/index.ts"
const metric = new SummarizationMetric(openai('gpt-4o-mini'));
```

## Example Usage

### High-quality Summary Example

Evaluate a summary that maintains both factual accuracy and complete coverage:

```typescript copy showLineNumbers{7} filename="src/index.ts"
const input1 = `The electric car company Tesla was founded in 2003 by Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning. 
Elon Musk joined in 2004 as the largest investor and became CEO in 2008. The company's first car, 
the Roadster, was launched in 2008.`;

const output1 = `Tesla, founded by Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning in 2003, launched its first car, 
the Roadster, in 2008. Elon Musk joined as the largest investor in 2004 and became CEO in 2008.`;

console.log('Example 1 - High-quality Summary:');
console.log('Input:', input1);
console.log('Output:', output1);

const result1 = await metric.measure(input1, output1);
console.log('Metric Result:', {
  score: result1.score,
  info: {
    reason: result1.info.reason,
    alignmentScore: result1.info.alignmentScore,
    coverageScore: result1.info.coverageScore,
  },
});
// Example Output:
// Metric Result: {
//   score: 1,
//   info: {
//     reason: "The score is 1 because the summary maintains perfect factual accuracy and includes all key information from the source text.",
//     alignmentScore: 1,
//     coverageScore: 1
//   }
// }
```

### Partial Coverage Example

Evaluate a summary that is factually accurate but omits important information:

```typescript copy showLineNumbers{24} filename="src/index.ts"
const input2 = `The Python programming language was created by Guido van Rossum and was first released 
in 1991. It emphasizes code readability with its notable use of significant whitespace. Python is 
dynamically typed and garbage-collected. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including 
structured, object-oriented, and functional programming.`;

const output2 = `Python, created by Guido van Rossum, is a programming language known for its readable 
code and use of whitespace. It was released in 1991.`;

console.log('Example 2 - Partial Coverage:');
console.log('Input:', input2);
console.log('Output:', output2);

const result2 = await metric.measure(input2, output2);
console.log('Metric Result:', {
  score: result2.score,
  info: {
    reason: result2.info.reason,
    alignmentScore: result2.info.alignmentScore,
    coverageScore: result2.info.coverageScore,
  },
});
// Example Output:
// Metric Result: {
//   score: 0.4,
//   info: {
//     reason: "The score is 0.4 because while the summary is factually accurate (alignment score: 1), it only covers a portion of the key information from the source text (coverage score: 0.4), omitting several important technical details.",
//     alignmentScore: 1,
//     coverageScore: 0.4
//   }
// }
```

### Inaccurate Summary Example

Evaluate a summary that contains factual errors and misrepresentations:

```typescript copy showLineNumbers{41} filename="src/index.ts"
const input3 = `The World Wide Web was invented by Tim Berners-Lee in 1989 while working at CERN. 
He published the first website in 1991. Berners-Lee made the Web freely available, with no patent 
and no royalties due.`;

const output3 = `The Internet was created by Tim Berners-Lee at MIT in the early 1990s, and he went 
on to commercialize the technology through patents.`;

console.log('Example 3 - Inaccurate Summary:');
console.log('Input:', input3);
console.log('Output:', output3);

const result3 = await metric.measure(input3, output3);
console.log('Metric Result:', {
  score: result3.score,
  info: {
    reason: result3.info.reason,
    alignmentScore: result3.info.alignmentScore,
    coverageScore: result3.info.coverageScore,
  },
});
// Example Output:
// Metric Result: {
//   score: 0,
//   info: {
//     reason: "The score is 0 because the summary contains multiple factual errors and misrepresentations of key details from the source text, despite covering some of the basic information.",
//     alignmentScore: 0,
//     coverageScore: 0.6
//   }
// }
```

## Understanding the Results

The metric evaluates summaries through two components:

1. Alignment Score (0-1):
   - 1.0: Perfect factual accuracy
   - 0.7-0.9: Minor factual discrepancies
   - 0.4-0.6: Some factual errors
   - 0.1-0.3: Significant inaccuracies
   - 0.0: Complete factual misrepresentation

2. Coverage Score (0-1):
   - 1.0: Complete information coverage
   - 0.7-0.9: Most key information included
   - 0.4-0.6: Partial coverage of key points
   - 0.1-0.3: Missing most important details
   - 0.0: No relevant information included

Final score is determined by the minimum of these two scores, ensuring that both factual accuracy and information coverage are necessary for a high-quality summary.
