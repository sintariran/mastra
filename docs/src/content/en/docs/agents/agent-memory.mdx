# Agent Memory

Agents in Mastra can leverage a powerful memory system to store conversation history, recall relevant information, and maintain persistent context across interactions. This allows agents to have more natural, stateful conversations.

## Enabling Memory for an Agent

To enable memory, simply instantiate the `Memory` class and pass it to your agent's configuration. You also need to install the memory package:

```bash npm2yarn copy
npm install @mastra/memory
```

```typescript
import { Agent } from "@mastra/core/agent";
import { Memory } from "@mastra/memory";
import { openai } from "@ai-sdk/openai";

// Basic memory setup
const memory = new Memory();

const agent = new Agent({
  name: "MyMemoryAgent",
  instructions: "You are a helpful assistant with memory.",
  model: openai("gpt-4o"),
  memory: memory, // Attach the memory instance
});
```

This basic setup uses default settings, including LibSQL for storage and FastEmbed for embeddings. For detailed setup instructions, see [Memory](/docs/memory/overview).

## Using Memory in Agent Calls

To utilize memory during interactions, you **must** provide `resourceId` and `threadId` when calling the agent's `stream()` or `generate()` methods.

- `resourceId`: Typically identifies the user or entity (e.g., `user_123`).
- `threadId`: Identifies a specific conversation thread (e.g., `support_chat_456`).

```typescript
// Example agent call using memory
await agent.stream("Remember my favorite color is blue.", {
  resourceId: "user_alice",
  threadId: "preferences_thread",
});

// Later in the same thread...
const response = await agent.stream("What's my favorite color?", {
  resourceId: "user_alice",
  threadId: "preferences_thread",
});
// Agent will use memory to recall the favorite color.
```

These IDs ensure that conversation history and context are correctly stored and retrieved for the appropriate user and conversation.

## Next Steps
