# Logging

In Mastra, logs can detail when certain functions run, what input data they receive, and how they respond.

## Basic Setup

Here's a minimal example that sets up a **console logger** at the `INFO` level. This will print out informational messages and above (i.e., `DEBUG`, `INFO`, `WARN`, `ERROR`) to the console.

```typescript filename="mastra.config.ts" showLineNumbers copy
import { Mastra } from "@mastra/core";
import { createLogger } from "@mastra/core/logger";

export const mastra = new Mastra({
  // Other Mastra configuration...
  logger: createLogger({
    name: "Mastra",
    level: "info",
  }),
});
```

In this configuration:

- `name: "Mastra"` specifies the name to group logs under.
- `level: "info"` sets the minimum severity of logs to record.

## Configuration

- For more details on the options you can pass to `createLogger()`, see the [createLogger reference documentation](/reference/observability/create-logger.mdx).
- Once you have a `Logger` instance, you can call its methods (e.g., `.info()`, `.warn()`, `.error()`) in the [Logger instance reference documentation](/reference/observability/logger.mdx).
- If you want to send your logs to an external service for centralized collection, analysis, or storage, you can configure other logger types such as Upstash Redis. Consult the [createLogger reference documentation](/reference/observability/create-logger.mdx) for details on parameters like `url`, `token`, and `key` when using the `UPSTASH` logger type.
