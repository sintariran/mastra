# Serverless Deployment

This guide covers deploying Mastra to Cloudflare Workers, Vercel, and Netlify using platform-specific deployers

For self-hosted Node.js server deployment, see the [Creating A Mastra Server](/docs/deployment/server) guide.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:

- **Node.js** installed (version 18 or higher is recommended)
- If using a platform-specific deployer:
  - An account with your chosen platform
  - Required API keys or credentials

## Serverless Platform Deployers

Platform-specific deployers handle configuration and deployment for:
- **[Cloudflare Workers](/reference/deployer/cloudflare)**
- **[Vercel](/reference/deployer/vercel)**
- **[Netlify](/reference/deployer/netlify)**

As of April 2025, Mastra also offers [Mastra Cloud](https://mastra.ai/cloud-beta), a serverless agent environment with atomic deployments. You can sign up for the waitlist [here](https://mastra.ai/cloud-beta).

### Installing Deployers

```bash copy
# For Cloudflare
npm install @mastra/deployer-cloudflare

# For Vercel
npm install @mastra/deployer-vercel

# For Netlify
npm install @mastra/deployer-netlify
```

### Configuring Deployers

Configure the deployer in your entry file:

```typescript copy showLineNumbers
import { Mastra, createLogger } from '@mastra/core';
import { CloudflareDeployer } from '@mastra/deployer-cloudflare';

export const mastra = new Mastra({
  agents: { /* your agents here */ },
  logger: createLogger({ name: 'MyApp', level: 'debug' }),
  deployer: new CloudflareDeployer({
    scope: 'your-cloudflare-scope',
    projectName: 'your-project-name',
    // See complete configuration options in the reference docs
  }),
});
```

### Deployer Configuration

Each deployer has specific configuration options. Below are basic examples, but refer to the reference documentation for complete details.

#### Cloudflare Deployer

```typescript copy showLineNumbers
new CloudflareDeployer({
  scope: 'your-cloudflare-account-id',
  projectName: 'your-project-name',
  // For complete configuration options, see the reference documentation
})
```

#### Vercel Deployer

```typescript copy showLineNumbers
new VercelDeployer({
  teamSlug: 'your-vercel-team-slug',
  projectName: 'your-project-name',
  token: 'your-vercel-token'
  // For complete configuration options, see the reference documentation
})
```

#### Netlify Deployer

```typescript copy showLineNumbers
new NetlifyDeployer({
  scope: 'your-netlify-team-slug',
  projectName: 'your-project-name',
  token: 'your-netlify-token'
})
```

## Environment Variables

Required variables:

1. Platform deployer variables (if using platform deployers):
   - Platform credentials
2. Agent API keys:
   - `OPENAI_API_KEY`
   - `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`
3. Server configuration (for universal deployment):
   - `PORT`: HTTP server port (default: 3000)
   - `HOST`: Server host (default: 0.0.0.0)

## Build Mastra Project

To build your Mastra project for your target platform run:

```bash
npx mastra build
```

When a Deployer is used, the build output is automatically prepared for the target platform.
You can then deploy the build output `.mastra/output` via your platform's (Vercel, netlify, cloudfare e.t.c) 
CLI/UI.
