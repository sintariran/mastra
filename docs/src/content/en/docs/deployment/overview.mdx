# Deployment Overview

Mastra offers multiple deployment options to suit your application's needs, from fully-managed solutions to self-hosted options. This guide will help you understand the available deployment paths and choose the right one for your project.

## Deployment Options

### Mastra Cloud

Mastra Cloud is a deployment platform that connects to your GitHub repository, automatically deploys on code changes, and provides monitoring tools. It includes:

- GitHub repository integration
- Deployment on git push
- Agent testing interface
- Comprehensive logs and traces
- Custom domains for each project

[View Mastra Cloud documentation →](/docs/mastra-cloud/overview)

### With a Server

You can deploy Mastra as a standard Node.js HTTP server, which gives you full control over your infrastructure and deployment environment.

- Custom API routes and middleware
- Configurable CORS and authentication
- Deploy to VMs, containers, or PaaS platforms
- Ideal for integrating with existing Node.js applications

### Serverless Platforms

Mastra provides platform-specific deployers for popular serverless platforms, enabling you to deploy your application with minimal configuration.

- Deploy to Cloudflare Workers, Vercel, or Netlify
- Platform-specific optimizations
- Simplified deployment process
- Automatic scaling through the platform

## Client Configuration

Once your Mastra application is deployed, you'll need to configure your client to communicate with it. The Mastra Client SDK provides a simple and type-safe interface for interacting with your Mastra server.

- Type-safe API interactions
- Authentication and request handling
- Retries and error handling
- Support for streaming responses
