# Observability in Mastra Cloud

Mastra Cloud records execution data for monitoring and debugging. It captures traces, logs, and runtime information from agents and workflows.

## Agent Interface

The agent interface offers three main views, accessible via tabs:

1. **Chat**: Interactive messaging interface to test your agent
2. **Traces**: Detailed execution records
3. **Evaluation**: Agent performance assessment

### Chat Interface

The Chat tab provides:

- Interactive messaging with deployed agents
- System response to user queries
- Suggested prompt buttons (e.g., "What capabilities do you have?")
- Message input area
- Branch indicator (e.g., "main")
- Note about agent memory limitations

### Agent Configuration Panel

The right sidebar displays agent details:

- Agent name and deployment identifier
- Model information (e.g., "OpenAI")
- Tools available to the agent (e.g., "getWeather")
- Complete system prompt text

This panel provides visibility into how the agent is configured without needing to check the source code.

## Trace System

Mastra Cloud records traces for agent and workflow interactions.

### Trace Explorer Interface

![Agent Traces View](/docs/cloud-agent-traces.png)

The Trace Explorer interface shows:

- All agent and workflow interactions
- Specific trace details
- Input and output data
- Tool calls with parameters and results
- Workflow execution paths
- Filtering options by type, status, timestamp, and agent/workflow

### Trace Data Structure

Each trace contains:

1. **Request Data**: The request that initiated the agent or workflow
2. **Tool Call Records**: Tool calls during execution with parameters
3. **Tool Response Data**: The responses from tool calls
4. **Agent Response Data**: The generated agent response
5. **Execution Timestamps**: Timing information for each execution step
6. **Model Metadata**: Information about model usage and tokens

The trace view displays all API calls and results throughout execution. This data helps debug tool usage and agent logic flows.

### Agent Interaction Data

Agent interaction traces include:

- User input text
- Agent processing steps
- Tool calls (e.g., weather API calls)
- Parameters and results for each tool call
- Final agent response text

## Dashboard Structure

The Mastra Cloud dashboard contains:

- Project deployment history
- Environment variable configuration
- Agent configuration details (model, system prompt, tools)
- Workflow step visualization
- Deployment URLs
- Recent activity log

## Agent Testing

Test your agents using the Chat interface:

1. Navigate to the Agents section
2. Select the agent you want to test
3. Use the Chat tab to interact with your agent
4. Send messages and view responses
5. Use suggested prompts for common queries
6. Switch to the Traces tab to view execution details

Note that by default, agents do not remember conversation history across sessions. The interface indicates this with the message: "Agent will not remember previous messages. To enable memory for agent see docs."

## Workflow Monitoring

![Workflow Interface](/docs/cloud-workflow.png)

Workflow monitoring shows:

- Diagram of workflow steps and connections
- Status for each workflow step
- Execution details for each step
- Execution trace records
- Multi-step process execution (e.g., weather lookup followed by activity planning)

### Workflow Execution

![Workflow Run Details](/docs/cloud-workflow-run.png)

When examining a specific workflow execution, you can see the detailed steps and their outputs.

## Logs

![Logs Interface](/docs/cloud-logs.png)

The Logs section provides detailed information about your application:

- **Time**: When the log entry was created
- **Level**: Log level (info, debug)
- **Hostname**: Server identification
- **Message**: Detailed log information, including:
  - API initialization
  - Storage connections
  - Agent and workflow activity

## Technical Features

The observability system includes:

- **API Endpoints**: For programmatic access to trace data
- **Structured Trace Format**: JSON format for filtering and query operations
- **Historical Data Storage**: Retention of past execution records
- **Deployment Version Links**: Correlation between traces and deployment versions

## Debugging Patterns

- Compare trace data when testing agent behavior changes
- Use the chat interface to test edge case inputs
- View system prompts to understand agent behavior
- Examine tool call parameters and results
- Verify workflow execution step sequencing
- Identify execution bottlenecks in trace timing data
- Compare trace differences between agent versions
