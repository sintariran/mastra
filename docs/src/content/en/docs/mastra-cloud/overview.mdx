# Mastra Cloud

Mastra Cloud is a deployment service that runs, manages, and monitors Mastra applications. It works with standard Mastra projects and handles deployment, scaling, and operational tasks.

## Core Functionality

- **Atomic Deployments** - Agents and workflows deploy as a single unit
- **Project Organization** - Group agents and workflows into projects with assigned URLs
- **Environment Variables** - Store configuration securely by environment
- **Testing Console** - Send messages to agents through a web interface
- **Execution Tracing** - Record agent interactions and tool calls
- **Workflow Visualization** - Display workflow steps and execution paths
- **Logs** - Standard logging output for debugging
- **Platform Compatibility** - Uses the same infrastructure as Cloudflare, Vercel, and Netlify deployers

## Dashboard Components

The Mastra Cloud dashboard contains:

- **Projects List** - All projects in the account
- **Project Details** - Deployments, environment variables, and access URLs
- **Deployment History** - Record of deployments with timestamps and status
- **Agent Inspector** - Agent configuration view showing models, tools, and system prompts
- **Testing Console** - Interface for sending messages to agents
- **Trace Explorer** - Records of tool calls, parameters, and responses
- **Workflow Viewer** - Diagram of workflow steps and connections

## Technical Implementation

Mastra Cloud runs on the same core code as the platform-specific deployers with these modifications:

- **Edge Network Distribution** - Geographically distributed execution
- **Dynamic Resource Allocation** - Adjusts compute resources based on traffic
- **Mastra-specific Runtime** - Runtime optimized for agent execution
- **Standard Deployment API** - Consistent deployment interface across environments
- **Tracing Infrastructure** - Records all agent and workflow execution steps

## Use Cases

Common usage patterns:

- Deploying applications without managing infrastructure
- Maintaining staging and production environments
- Monitoring agent behavior across many requests
- Testing agent responses through a web interface
- Deploying to multiple regions
