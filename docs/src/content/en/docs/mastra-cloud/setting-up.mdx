# Setting Up a Mastra Cloud Project

This page describes the steps to set up a project on Mastra Cloud using GitHub integration.

## Prerequisites

- A Mastra Cloud account
- A GitHub account
- A GitHub repository containing a Mastra application

## Project Creation Process

1. **Sign in to Mastra Cloud**
   - Navigate to the Mastra Cloud dashboard at https://cloud.mastra.ai
   - Sign in with your account credentials

2. **Add a New Project**
   - From the "All Projects" view, click the "Add new" button in the top right
   - This opens the GitHub repository import dialog

3. **Import Git Repository**
   - Search for repositories or select from the list of available GitHub repositories
   - Click the "Import" button next to the repository you want to deploy

4. **Configure Deployment Details**
   The deployment configuration page includes:
   - **Repo Name**: The GitHub repository name (read-only)
   - **Project Name**: Customize the project name (defaults to repo name)
   - **Branch**: Select the branch to deploy (dropdown, defaults to `main`)
   - **Project root**: Set the root directory of your project (defaults to `/`)
   - **Mastra Directory**: Specify where Mastra files are located (defaults to `src/mastra`)
   - **Build Command**: Optional command to run during build process
   - **Store Settings**: Configure data storage options
   - **Environment Variables**: Add key-value pairs for configuration (e.g., API keys)

## Project Structure Requirements

Mastra Cloud scans the GitHub repository for:

- **Agents**: Agent definitions (e.g., Weather Agent) with models and tools
- **Workflows**: Workflow step definitions (e.g., weather-workflow)
- **Environment Variables**: Required API keys and configuration variables

The repository should contain a standard Mastra project structure for proper detection and deployment.

## Understanding the Dashboard

After creating a project, the dashboard shows:

### Project Overview

- **Created Date**: When the project was created
- **Domains**: URLs for accessing your deployed application
  - Format: `https://[project-name].mastra.cloud`
  - Format: `https://[random-id].mastra.cloud`
- **Status**: Current deployment status (success or archived)
- **Branch**: The branch deployed (typically `main`)
- **Environment Variables**: Configured API keys and settings
- **Workflows**: List of detected workflows with step counts
- **Agents**: List of detected agents with models and tools
- **Database Usage**: Reads, writes, and storage statistics

### Deployments Section

- List of all deployments with:
  - Deployment ID (based on commit hash)
  - Status (success/archived)
  - Branch
  - Commit hash
  - Timestamp

### Logs Section

The Logs view displays:

- Timestamp for each log entry
- Log level (info, debug)
- Hostname
- Detailed log messages, including:
  - API startup information
  - Storage initialization
  - Agent and workflow activity

## Navigation

The sidebar provides access to:

- **Overview**: Project summary and statistics
- **Deployments**: Deployment history and details
- **Logs**: Application logs for debugging
- **Agents**: List and configuration of all agents
- **Workflows**: List and structure of all workflows
- **Settings**: Project configuration options

## Environment Variable Configuration

Set environment variables through the dashboard:

1. Navigate to your project in the dashboard
2. Go to the "Environment Variables" section
3. Add or edit variables (such as `OPENAI_API_KEY`)
4. Save the configuration

Environment variables are encrypted and made available to your application during deployment and execution.

## Testing Your Deployment

After deployment, you can test your agents and workflows using:

1. The custom domain assigned to your project: `https://[project-name].mastra.cloud`
2. The dashboard interface for direct interaction with agents

## Next Steps

After setting up your project, automatic deployments occur whenever you push to the `main` branch of your GitHub repository. See the [deployment documentation](/docs/mastra-cloud/deploying) for more details.
