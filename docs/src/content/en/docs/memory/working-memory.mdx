# Working Memory

While [conversation history](/docs/memory/overview#conversation-history) and [semantic recall](./semantic-recall.mdx) help agents remember conversations, working memory allows them to maintain persistent information about users across interactions within a thread.

Think of it as the agent's active thoughts or scratchpad â€“ the key information they keep available about the user or task. It's similar to how a person would naturally remember someone's name, preferences, or important details during a conversation.

This is useful for maintaining ongoing state that's always relevant and should always be available to the agent.

## Quick Start

Here's a minimal example of setting up an agent with working memory:

```typescript {12-15}
import { Agent } from "@mastra/core/agent";
import { Memory } from "@mastra/memory";
import { openai } from "@ai-sdk/openai";

// Create agent with working memory enabled
const agent = new Agent({
  name: "PersonalAssistant",
  instructions: "You are a helpful personal assistant.",
  model: openai("gpt-4o"),
  memory: new Memory({
    options: {
      workingMemory: {
        enabled: true,
        use: "tool-call", // Recommended setting
      },
    },
  }),
});
```

## How it Works

Working memory is a block of Markdown text that the agent is able to update over time to store continuously relevant information:

## Custom Templates

Templates guide the agent on what information to track and update in working memory. While a default template is used if none is provided, you'll typically want to define a custom template tailored to your agent's specific use case to ensure it remembers the most relevant information.

Here's an example of a custom template. In this example the agent will store the users name, location, timezone, etc as soon as the user sends a message containing any of the info:

```typescript {5-28}
const memory = new Memory({
  options: {
    workingMemory: {
      enabled: true,
      template: `
# User Profile
 
## Personal Info
 
- Name:
- Location:
- Timezone:
 
## Preferences
 
- Communication Style: [e.g., Formal, Casual]
- Project Goal:
- Key Deadlines:
  - [Deadline 1]: [Date]
  - [Deadline 2]: [Date]
 
## Session State
 
- Last Task Discussed:
- Open Questions:
  - [Question 1]
  - [Question 2]
`,
    },
  },
});
```

If your agent is not properly updating working memory when you expect it to, you can add system instructions on _how_ and _when_ to use this template in your agents `instruction` setting.
